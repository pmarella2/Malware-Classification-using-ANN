## **Introduction:**
This was my final project for an Operating Systems Security graduate class. I always had an interest in learning more about Machine Learning/Artificial Intelligence but never really had the chance to dive into it. So, for my final project I thought I would challenge myself by choosing a topic that utilized ML/AI.

I proposed using the API call sequences extracted from performing dynamic analysis on various malware sample spanning across eight different classes including Adware, Backdoor, Downloader, Dropper, Spyware, Trojan, Virus, and Worm to build an efficient and accurate malware classifier. Then, I built a multi-class classifier artificial neural network (ANN) that used the processed API call sequence data fed into sequential models with fully connected, Dense, layers to predict the malware classifications.

There were four main steps in my approach for building and testing the malware classifier:
+ **Pre-process and Load Data**: The key to working with a neural network is processed data that we can feed into a ANN model. Typically, this means working with normalized numerical data.
+ **Define Model**: To feed our pre-processed data, we need to have a ANN model defined. A defined model includes choosing the layers, algorithms, activators, optimizer, and input/output sizes.
+ **Train and Test**: Now that we have an ANN model defined, we need to choose a way to split our data and train our model. Here we also need to define the number of epochs - the number of times the model runs through an entire training set. Then we use the leftover data to test and validate the accuracy of our model.
+ **Interpret Results**: We need to interpret the results we get from our validation steps. Typically, this includes evaluating the average accuracy score and looking at the confusion matrix.

**Update in progress.** I will be cleaning up the code, adding more details about the various code files, and a run down on the pre-processed/processed datasets as I find more time. I will also write more information about the project and my results.
